_Or: Why am I writing this on GitHub dot com?_

I hate writing. But I love _having written_. It's terrible.

Because I love having written, I'm constantly trying to start writing. But, starting writing is the _worst_ part of writing, by a mile -- there's the most empty white space ahead of you, and you're nowhere close to being "on a roll". So a lot of times, I'll start writing, write three sentences, and get distracted by something else. Usually food.

It looks like I've made it past the three sentence mark, so I guess we'll keep going!

For the longest time, I told myself I didn't write because I had nowhere to write. That was a convenient excuse. For a while I tried Medium, but I kind of hate the idea of tossing stuff into an (albeit beautiful) walled garden with no easy way to get it back out. It didn't feel like "my writing" -- it felt like Medium's. Same thing with Substack. i'll take any excuse not to write, and that's been a good one.

Before that, my solution to "nowhere to write stuff" was to sign up for a Wordpress or Blogger account, or run some blogging software somewhere, and start customizing it. Three hours of CSS and sketchy plugins later, I was spent, and hadn't written a single word.

Eventually I realized I spend all day in GitHub anyway, and I've gotten pretty accustomed to Markdown, and GitHub's Markdown experience specifically. It's really easy to create a repo or a Gist, write a quick README, share it with folks, and for a while sometimes I did that. Before long I realized I could just keep a single repo just for writing things into. And that's what this is!

It's got some other benefits too. Like there's no comments section! If you disagree with something about this post, there's no textbox on the page to start spewing your (misguided, uninformed, pedestrian) disagreement into. At the same time, you can open a PR to fix a typo, or suggest an edit, or open an issue to ask a question or give feedback. I can close those if I don't want to keep doing them. So far, only [one person has done this](https://github.com/imjasonh/ImJasonH/issues/3) but they figured out they could do that without me having to tell them, so the system must be working.

I can make edits any time, and they're audited in history, but I can also rewrite history if I ever need to.

If you're determined to get updates when I write things, you can Watch the repo and get emails, or if you're one of those weirdos who uses RSS, [GitHub does that too](https://github.com/imjasonh/ImJasonH/commits/main.atom?path=articles) (both of those are going to be a feed for all edits, sorry). Or you can just check back here sometimes.

This is more about me writing than you reading, if I'm being honest.
