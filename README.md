# Hi, I'm Jason H ðŸ‘‹

### (he/him)

I work at [<img src="https://github.com/ImJasonH/ImJasonH/blob/main/redhat.png" alt="Red Hat" width="26" height="20" />Red Hat](https://redhat.com) working on developer tools, including [<img src="https://github.com/ImJasonH/ImJasonH/blob/main/tekton.png" alt="Tekton" width="20" height="20"/>Tekton](https://tekton.dev).

Before that I was at [<img src="https://github.com/ImJasonH/ImJasonH/blob/main/cloud.png" alt="Google Cloud" width="20" height="20" />Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com), where I cofounded [<img src="https://github.com/ImJasonH/ImJasonH/blob/main/gcb.png" alt="Google Cloud Build" width="20" height="20" />Google Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build). 

You can also find me on
[<img src="https://github.com/ImJasonH/ImJasonH/blob/main/twitter.png" alt="Twitter" width="20" height="20"/>Twitter](https://twitter.com/imjasonh).

I contribute to [`ko`](https://github.com/google/ko) and [go-containerregistry](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry)

I build fun toys like https://kontain.me and https://gcping.com

## Resume

My resume is a CRD you can install on your Kubernetes cluster:

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ImJasonH/ImJasonH/main/resume-crd.yaml
```

(You wouldn't install something off the internet without [reading it
first](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ImJasonH/ImJasonH/main/resume-crd.yaml),
_would you?!_)
